    "text": "Introduction\nSpace is the final frontier, inspiring awe and curiosity from humanity across the ages. Space exploration refers to the ongoing pursuit of discovering and understanding the vast expanse beyond our planet Earth. It encompasses a range of activities including launching and operating spacecraft, conducting scientific research, and developing technologies that allow us to explore deeper into the cosmos. From the first human journey into space by Yuri Gagarin in 1961 to the latest robotic missions to Mars and beyond, space exploration has captivated the imagination of people around the world and remains a vital aspect of our scientific and technological advancement. Through space exploration, we are able to gain a better understanding of our universe and our place within it. In this project, I will be exploring those that made the journey to the final frontier to gain more insight to the similarities that they share, what roles they played, and how these demographics varied across nations and time.\n\nQuestions:\nIn this project, I answered the following questions:\nWhat country has the most mission time?\nWhat is the average year of age of astronauts during their mission?\nHow many astronauts had extravehicular activities (EVAs)? What is the average amount they spent doing EVAs?\nWhat shuttles were used the most?"

These methods include creating pie charts to display categorical data, bar graphs to compare quantities, and histograms to show the distribution of numerical data. Stacked bar graphs have been used to show how multiple variables contribute to a single category, specifically how the genders of astronauts are distributed in their respective categories. Scatter plots have been used to show how two numerical variables may be related to each other and draw conclusions from said relation. Statistical measures such as the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and trimmed mean have been used to describe numerical data. These methods have been used to gain insights into various aspects of the data, including mission details, astronaut demographics, and mission outcomes. All of these techniques were performed in Jupyter Notebook using Python."

    "text": "Data Exploration\nAfter analyzing the data set, several statistics caught my attention. Firstly, it was revealed that all astronauts included in the dataset had a military background. Secondly, the statistics for the mission time were as follows: the mean mission time was 1052.02 days, the median was 261.00 days, the mode was 283.00 days, and the 10% trimmed mean was 675.58 days, indicating the presence of an outlier that significantly affected the mean. It was also found that there were few astronauts that performed extra-vehicular activities (EVAs), as the mean EVA time was 3.67 hours, the median was 0.00 hours, and the mode was 0.00. The 10% trimmed mean for EVA time was 1.93 hours, indicating that the presence of an outlier once again raised the mean significantly.\n\nData Visualizations\nThe code below shows the libraries and methods I utilized to answer these questions:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport datetime as dt\n\n\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef pdcorgis(a):\n    dataset_name = a.lower()\n    dataset_name = dataset_name.replace(' ', '_')\n    data_url = f\"https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/{dataset_name}/\"\n    \n    response = requests.get(data_url)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, \"html.parser\")\n    \n    for i in soup.find_all(\"a\"):\n        if i.has_attr(\"download\"):\n            csv_file = i[\"href\"]\n            break\n    \n    csv_url = f\"https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/{dataset_name}/{csv_file}\"\n    df = pd.read_csv(csv_url)\n    \n    return df\n  \nastronauts_df = pdcorgis(\"Astronauts\")\n\n\n# Calculate the number of astronauts by gender\ngender_counts = astronauts_df['Profile.Gender'].value_counts()\n\n# Create a pie chart showing the gender distribution\nplt.pie(gender_counts.values, labels=gender_counts.index, autopct='%1.1f%%')\nplt.title('Astronauts by Gender')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nHere, we see an overwhelming majority of the astronauts are male.\n\n# Create a pivot table to count the number of astronauts by nationality and gender\nnationality_gender_counts = pd.pivot_table(astronauts_df, values='Profile.Name', index='Profile.Nationality', columns='Profile.Gender', aggfunc='count', fill_value=0)\n\n# Get the top ten nationalities\ntop_nationalities = nationality_gender_counts.sum(axis=1).sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)\n\n# Get the data for the top ten nationalities\ntop_nationality_data = nationality_gender_counts.loc[top_nationalities.index]\n\n# Create a stacked bar chart showing the gender distribution by nationality\ntop_nationality_data.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True)\nplt.title('Gender Distribution by Nationality (Top 10)')\nplt.xlabel('Nationality')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Astronauts')\nplt.legend(title='Gender')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe USA has a clear lead when it comes to the number of astronauts that have been sent to space and have also been the country to send the most female astronauts to space.\n\n# Group the data by country and calculate the total mission time\ncountry_group = astronauts_df.groupby('Profile.Nationality')['Profile.Lifetime Statistics.Mission duration'].sum()\n\n# Sort the data in descending order based on the total mission time\ncountry_group = country_group.sort_values(ascending=False)\n\n# Select the top ten countries\ntop_ten_countries = country_group.head(10)\n\n# Create a bar graph\ntop_ten_countries.plot(kind='bar')\n\n# Set x-axis label\nplt.xlabel('Country')\n\n# Set y-axis label\nplt.ylabel('Total Mission Time (days)')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nRussia/USSR has a decisive lead over the US in terms of time spent on mission in space, trailed by the US with the two leaving all other countries far behind.\n\n# Convert birth year to datetime and calculate the age of the astronaut at the time of their mission\nastronauts_df['Mission.Year'] = pd.to_datetime(astronauts_df['Mission.Year'], format='%Y')\nastronauts_df['Profile.Birth Year'] = pd.to_datetime(astronauts_df['Profile.Birth Year'], format='%Y')\nastronauts_df['age_at_mission'] = ((astronauts_df['Mission.Year'] - astronauts_df['Profile.Birth Year']).dt.days / 365).astype(int)\n\n# Create a histogram showing the distribution of astronaut ages during their mission year\nplt.hist(astronauts_df['age_at_mission'], bins=20)\nplt.title('Age Distribution of Astronauts During Mission Year')\nplt.xlabel('Age')\nplt.ylabel('Count of Astronauts')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nIn the histogram, we see the ages of astronauts at the time of their mission.

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\nThroughout this analysis of the astronaut data, several key questions were answered. It was found that despite not having the most astronauts sent to space, the USSR/Russia had a significantly higher amount of time spent on mission. Additionally, a histogram of astronaut ages during their missions showed that the average age was around 40 years old, slightly higher than the current average age, 34. Examining the amount of time spent on EVAs, it was found that the average was 3.67 hours, with flight engineers having the most EVA time out of all roles. These extravehicular activities could range from reconfiguring cooling loops on laboratory modules to securing radiators on the outside of a spacecraft. Finally, the analysis found that the most used shuttle for both ascent and descent was the STS-42, which was used eight times. The STS-42 was iconic, taking a crew of eight astronauts on both ascent and descent with members from the United States, Canada, and Germany, one of whom was Canada’s first female astronaut. These findings help provide insight into the history of space exploration and the roles played by various countries, shuttles, and astronaut roles in space missions.\nFurther analysis revealed that only 11.2 percent of all astronauts were female. Despite this, the United States had the largest number of female astronauts, indicating a greater push for inclusivity and diversity in space exploration. Among the different mission roles, mission specialists had the highest number of females, while commanders had the fewest. This suggests that there may be a gender bias in certain roles and highlights the importance of promoting gender equality in the field of space exploration."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nWhen I initially selected this dataset, I had done so with the intention of trying to see trends in the advancement of space technology as time progressed, spurred on by the fact that there has not been a manned mission to the moon since the Apollo 17 mission on the 19th of December in 1972. However, upon further analysis the disparity of space access by both gender and nationality was much more prominent and pointed. While recent classes of astronauts that NASA has graduated have done better to counteract this disparity by having more even numbers of male and female astronauts, much work remains in breaking through this final frontier.\nIn conclusion, although drastic improvement is space technology over the past decades have allowed for the United States to take a prominent role in space exploration, we must also take an active role in allowing others equal access to this domain. The benefits of more groups bringing new ideas to space research and technology cannot be overstated and is key to the future endeavors of humanity."
